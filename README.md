# Still a work under progress. Wait until I've finished it to read it!

To put it simply, this is a list of front-end tricks and tips for people who already know a bit of HTML and CSS. My aim is to empower  you to use the front-end tools as most tutorials seem to be syntax based.

Let's dive straight into it. :ok_hand:

### Everything to do with Text
___
The way text is laid out is an art. Keep in mind, there aren't rigid logical rules that govern it's implementation but a little guidance will help you on your way.
###### Sans Serif vs Serif
___
Serifs are the small lines trailing from the edges of letteres whilst Sans-Serif (this font right now if you're reading on Github) does not have serifs. Serif fonts are easier for reading as the serifs make the letters stand out which makes our brains recognise them quicker. Sans-serif are usually used on the web as the resolution of a screen is much less than that of print. 
######Where to find good fonts
___
Google Fonts<br>
Font Squirrel<br>
TypeKit (Adobe) - <b>Recommended</b>

###### Using CSS to make your text go that extra mile
___
The tools:<br>
<code>
letter-spacing, line-height, text-transform, text-indent, text-shadow, word-spacing, text-decoration, text-align, font-variant, font-weight, font, 
</code>

<b>Tips</b>

<b>font-weight</b> can be used to give emphasis to different type. 

You should use <b>letter-spacing</b> to make text more open and inviting. But careful, you don't want to be too open... In general, larger type needs less letter spacing and tiny type such as those in footnotes is made that little bit more readable by opening the spacing a bit more. Try to strike the right balance in between.

### Using Icons
___
Giving the user a visual indication for something is a great way to speed up the process of the user finding the resource they need from a website. It is no surprise that they're commonly used in menus,

# Design Theory
___
Design theory in it's essence, are a bunch of principles which aim to pinpoint the aesthetic instinct for what looks good. I will list a few of the theories I think are essential to reaching a good level of web design. 

##### Fibonacci and the Golden Ratio
___

F

##### Semiotics
___

Semiotics is the study of signs. Signs in web design would include logos, words, icons and pictures. Naturally, us humans read these signs as visual cues to interpret information from. 

##### Mathematics and Design

##### Colour Theory

###### Space
___
Placing space into sections helps reduce noise, increase readability and go a long way in creating illusion. Space can reduce overwhelming design and guide the user much more easier to where they want to go.

###### Unity
___
Unity is when all the elements on your page visually or conceptually appear related to ach other. A good design is finding the right balance between unity and variety in order to avoid boring or overwhelming websites.

###### Grid Theory
